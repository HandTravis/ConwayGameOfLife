Use conway-life-grid-init.cpp to create an initial grid for the game of life. This script creates two copies of the same grid, to compare the output of running the threaded (threaded-life.cpp) 
and non-threaded (conway-life.cpp) verions of the algorithm. Use conway_display.py to visualize the game of life using python, and conway-life-compare-grids.cpp to comapare two grids.
